# iOS Text Replacement

iOS can speed up typing by auto-replacing sequences of text with a modified version.

## Installation

1. Go to <kbd>Settings > General > Keyboard > Text Replacement</kbd>.
2. Use the <kbd>+</kbd> (Plus) and <kbd>-</kbd> (Minus) buttons to add/remove text replacement pairs.

iOS comes with a single pair: `omw` becomes `On My Way!`.

## Usage

1. Type a sequence that appears in the list for _Text Replacement_.
2. The sequence will automatically be replaced with its equivalent.
